## Executive Summary
Include your executive summary here... refer back to lab 1 executive summary if helpful

## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal system uses 10 as a Base; Represents numbers using 0-9

Binary system uses 2 as a Base; Represents numbers using 0-1

Hexadecimal system uses 16 as a Base;  Represents numbers using 10 digits(0-9) and 6 characters(A-F) 
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
The color #ab00ff is a very vibrant purple. The decimal variation of this color is 11206911. I think the color would pose itself to being problematic because most people who have color vision deficiency won't be able to even get close to seeing the color. An alternative would be #B084DC with a darker contrasting color like #000000.
