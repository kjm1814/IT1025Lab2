## Executive Summary
Include your executive summary here... refer back to lab 1 executive summary if helpful

## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal system uses 10 as a Base; Represents numbers using 0-9

Binary system uses 2 as a Base; Represents numbers using 0-1

Hexadecimal system uses 16 as a Base;  Represents numbers using 10 digits(0-9) and 6 characters(A-F) 
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
The color #ab00ff is a very vibrant purple. The decimal variation of this color is 11206911. I think the color would pose itself to being problematic because most people who have color vision deficiency won't be able to even get close to seeing the color. An alternative would be #B084DC with a darker contrasting color like #000000.
## Software
### Types of Software
Application Software is utilized directly today to accomplish a specific goal; i.e, Word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet or surfing the web.

Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way; i.e, Anti-malware

Operating Systems manage the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user; MacOS, Microsoft Windows and Android
### ERP
Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP) was developed to bring together an entire organization under one program. Microsoft, Oracle and SAP have their own ERP systems.
## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Virtualization helps to reduce the number of physical servers need to provide necessary services. This allows for the computer to use its full capabilities. 
### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisor gives multiple useres simulataneous access to computers that perform batch processing.
## Python
### Advantages of Python
-Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
-Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
-Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
-With Interpreted languages, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. It is also slower than compiled languages. 
-Compiled languages convert directly into machine code so that the processor can execute. It gives developers more control over hardware aspects like memory management and CPU usage.
