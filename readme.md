## Executive Summary
Lab 2 introduces us to coding and our IT opportunities at Cuyahoga Community College.  We also will learn about Python and how to convert amongst different data representation methods 

## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
The Decimal system uses 10 as a Base; Represents numbers using 0-9

The Binary system uses 2 as a Base; Represents numbers using 0-1

The Hexadecimal system uses 16 as a Base;  Represents numbers using 10 digits(0-9) and 6 characters(A-F) 
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
The color #ab00ff is a very vibrant purple. The decimal variation of this color is 11206911. I think the color would pose itself to being problematic because most people who have color vision deficiency won't be able to even get close to seeing the color. An alternative would be #B084DC with a darker contrasting color like #000000.
## Software
### Types of Software
Application Software is utilized directly today to accomplish a specific goal; i.e, Word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet or web surfing.

Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way; i.e, Anti-malware

Operating Systems manage the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user; MacOS, Microsoft Windows and Android
### ERP
Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP) was developed to bring together an entire organization under one program. Microsoft, Oracle and SAP have their ERP systems.
## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Virtualization helps to reduce the number of physical servers need to provide necessary services. This allows for the computer to use its full capabilities. 
### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisor gives multiple users simultaneous access to computers that perform batch processing.
## Python
### Advantages of Python
-Python has a syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
-Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
-Python uses new lines to complete a command, instead of other programming languages that often use semicolons or parentheses.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
-With Interpreted languages, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. It is also slower than compiled languages. 
-Compiled languages convert directly into machine code so that the processor can execute. It gives developers more control over hardware aspects like memory management and CPU usage. 
## Career Exploration
### Handshake
I was familiar with Handshake having used it at my alma mater. Creating a new profile with my career focus being in IT was a really good way to see what current opportunities look like. I got to see what qualifications employers are looking for.
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
I was unfamiliar with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I like how it breaks down what the projections are in terms of job growth for the job type. I saw the job, "Information Security Analyst", which intrigued me. It will experience 31% from 2019-2029.
### Certifications
CompTIA- is a certification that I know I will need when I decide to go into Cybersecurity. According to their site, "It will validate an IT professional’s ability to proactively defend and continuously improve the security of an organization." It seems to be an advanced certification being that it requires a minimum of 4 years of hands-on information security or related experience. 
### Certificates and Degrees
I took the Software development quiz that Tri-C offers and it said that I would be good in Cybersecurity, Networking Hardware and Networking Software programs. After reading about the program, I will be pursuing an Associate of Applied Business in Cybersecurity degree. 
### Co-ops / Internships
For a student to be considered "co-op ready", they have to meet the following requirements: 

Currently enrolled at Cuyahoga Community College
Completed 12 credit hours of college coursework (includes transfer credits) with at least two courses related to your major field
GPA of 2.75 or higher

With a co-op, you get real-world experience that also counts as course credit. It looks great on a resumé as it shows employers that you know how to apply what you have learned in the classroom to the real world. 
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
A club that I would be interested in is the Cybersecurity club at the west campus. As I declare my major in Cybersecurity, I know it will be beneficial to network and learn from other students interested in Cybersecurity. 
## Conclusion
Lab 2 was challenging and fun. Learning about Hexadecimal and how to convert was cool. Having heard about Python, it was amazing to use the system. Having to read about certifications and potential job opportunities was introspective. It helped me to narrow down what I would like my major to be as I continue at Tri-C.
