# This is our first Python program.  Here you will practice using variables to hold content
# and the print function to ouput information.
# Start by creating a variable called: name to store your name
# here is an example: name="Kate"
# next use the print function to output the word "Hello " and then your name
# remember to start with w3schools to learn the concepts, note that the 
# concatenation characer is the "+" sign and, include a space after the word "Hello".
